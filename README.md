We investigate present several methods for identifying like-question pairs posted on Quora.

Methods reviewed include word and character n-grams, TF-IDF and cosine similarity, Levenshtein distance, Doc2Vec similarity, and various Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In addition to models, we consider feature enhancement using POS (part-of-speech) tags and various embedding layers. 

Overall, RNN-CNN performed best with slight variances in results when using different embedding layers.
